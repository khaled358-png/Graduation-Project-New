Functional Requirements

These are the features the website must directly provide:

Display the Home page with restaurant information.

Display the Menu with dish names, descriptions, and prices.

Display the Contact Us page with the restaurant location and opening hours.

Enable navigation between pages via the Navigation Bar.

Support automatic deployment using a CI/CD pipeline on an EC2 server.

Automate infrastructure setup using Terraform and Ansible.

Allow easy addition of new content (dishes, prices, texts) without breaking the website.




Non-Functional Requirements

These are general qualities and constraints, not direct features:

Performance: Pages should load quickly.

Usability: Simple and clear design for an easy user experience.

Availability: The website should be accessible at all times (depending on EC2 deployment).

Maintainability: Code should be easy to modify and develop, with the pipeline enabling fast updates.

Scalability: Easy to add new features like forms or extra menu items.

Security: Protect server access via SSH Keys and secure the EC2 Security Group.
